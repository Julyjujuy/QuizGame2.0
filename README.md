# Quiz Game 2.0


## This is one of my first exercises in c#.
### A simulated Quiz Game game in a console application. Feel free to use the code and the functions, as it's public.

I've build it to learn how to code.

Thanks to [Rakete Mentoring Group](https://raketementoring.com/) to bring me near this project.
